# Approov Token Binding Quickstart

This quickstart is for developers familiar with the Python Django framework who are looking for a quick intro into how they can add [Approov](https://approov.io) into an existing project. Therefore this will guide you through the necessary steps for adding Approov with token binding to an existing Python Django API server.

## How it works?

For more background, see the overview in the [README](/README.md#how-it-works) at the root of this repo.

The main functionality for the Approov token check is in the file [approov_middleware.py](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello/approov_middleware.py). Take a look at the `verifyApproovToken()` and `verifyApproovTokenBinding()` functions to see the simple code for the checks.

## Requirements

To complete this quickstart you will need both the Python and the Approov CLI tool installed.

* Python - Follow the official installation instructions from [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
* Approov CLI - Follow our [installation instructions](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/#approov-tool) and read more about each command and its options in the [documentation reference](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/)

## Approov Setup

To use Approov with the Python Django API server we need a small amount of configuration. First, Approov needs to know the API domain that will be protected. Second, the Python Django API server needs the Approov Base64 encoded secret that will be used to verify the tokens generated by the Approov cloud service.

### Configure API Domain

Approov needs to know the domain name of the API for which it will issue tokens.

Add it with:

```text
approov api -add your.api.domain.com
```

Adding the API domain also configures the [dynamic certificate pinning](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-dynamic-pinning) setup, out of the box.

> **NOTE:** By default the pin is extracted from the public key of the leaf certificate served by the domain, as visible to the box executing the Approov CLI command and the Approov servers.

### Approov Secret

Approov tokens are signed with a symmetric secret. To verify tokens, we need to grab the secret using the [Approov secret command](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/#secret-command) and plug it into the Python Django API server environment to check the signatures of the [Approov Tokens](https://www.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) that it processes.

Retrieve the Approov secret with:

```text
approov secret -get base64
```

> **NOTE:** The `approov secret` command requires an [administration role](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#account-access-roles) to execute successfully.

#### Set the Approov Secret

Open the `.env` file and add the Approov secret to the var:

```text
APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET=approov_base64_secret_here
```

## Approov Token Check

To check the Approov token we will use the [jpadilla/pyjwt/](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/) package, but you are free to use another one of your preference.

Add the [approov_middleware.py](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello/approov_middleware.py) class to your project:

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse
from os import getenv
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
import base64
import jwt # https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/
import hashlib

# @link https://django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/http/middleware.html
class ApproovMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

        load_dotenv(find_dotenv(), override=True)

        # Token secret value obtained with the Approov CLI tool:
        #  - approov secret -get
        approov_base64_secret = getenv('APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET')

        if approov_base64_secret == None:
            raise ValueError("Missing the value for environment variable: APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET")

        self.APPROOV_SECRET = base64.b64decode(approov_base64_secret)

    def __call__(self, request):
        approov_token_claims = self.verifyApproovToken(request)

        if approov_token_claims == None:
            return JsonResponse({}, status = 401)

        if self.verifyApproovTokenBinding(request, approov_token_claims) == False:
            return JsonResponse({}, status = 401)

        return self.get_response(request)

    # @link https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#backend-integration
    def verifyApproovToken(self, request):
        approov_token = request.headers.get("Approov-Token")

        # If we didn't find a token, then reject the request.
        if approov_token == None:
            # You may want to add some logging here.
            return None

        try:
            # Decode the Approov token explicitly with the HS256 algorithm to avoid
            # the algorithm None attack.
            approov_token_claims = jwt.decode(approov_token, self.APPROOV_SECRET, algorithms=['HS256'])
            return approov_token_claims
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError as e:
            # You may want to add some logging here.
            return None
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError as e:
            # You may want to add some logging here.
            return None

    # @link https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#token-binding
    def verifyApproovTokenBinding(self, request, approov_token_claims):
        if not 'pay' in approov_token_claims:
            # You may want to add some logging here.
            return False

        # We use the Authorization token, but feel free to use another header in
        # the request. Beqar in mind that it needs to be the same header used in the
        # mobile app to qbind the request with the Approov token.
        token_binding_header = request.headers.get("Authorization")

        if not token_binding_header:
            # You may want to add some logging here.
            return False

        # We need to hash and base64 encode the token binding header, because that's
        # how it was included in the Approov token on the mobile app.
        token_binding_header_hash = hashlib.sha256(token_binding_header.encode('utf-8')).digest()
        token_binding_header_encoded = base64.b64encode(token_binding_header_hash).decode('utf-8')

        if approov_token_claims['pay'] == token_binding_header_encoded:
            return True

        return False
```

Now, to activate the [Approov Middleware](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello/approov_middleware.py) you just need to include it in the middleware list of your [Django settings](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello/settings.py) as the first one in the list:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    'YOUR_APP_NAME.approov_middleware.ApproovMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    # lines omitted
]
```

> **NOTE:** The Approov middleware is included as the first one in the list because you don't want to waste your server resources in processing requests that don't have a valid Approov token. This approach will help your server to handle more load under a Denial of Service(DoS) attack.

A full working example for a simple Hello World server can be found at [src/approov-protected-server/token-check](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check).

> **NOTE:** When the Approov token validation fails we return a `401` with an empty body, because we don't want to give clues to an attacker about the reason the request failed, and you can go even further by returning a `400`.

## Test your Approov Integration

The following examples below use cURL, but you can also use the [Postman Collection](/README.md#testing-with-postman) to make the API requests. Just remember that you need to adjust the urls and tokens defined in the collection to match your deployment. Alternatively, the above README also contains instructions for using the preset _dummy_ secret to test your Approov integration.

#### With Valid Approov Tokens

Generate a valid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```
approov token -setDataHashInToken 'Bearer authorizationtoken' -genExample your.api.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer authorizationtoken' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The request should be accepted. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

...

{"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

#### With Invalid Approov Tokens

##### No Authorization Token

Let's just remove the Authorization header from the request:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

...

{}
```

##### Same Approov Token with a Different Authorization Token

Make the request with the same generated token, but with another random authorization token:

```
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer anotherauthorizationtoken' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should also fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

...

{}
```
