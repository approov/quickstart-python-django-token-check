# Approov QuickStart - Python Django Token Check

[Approov](https://approov.io) is an API security solution used to verify that requests received by your backend services originate from trusted versions of your mobile apps.

This repo implements the Approov server-side request verification code in Python, which performs the verification check before allowing valid traffic to be processed by the API endpoint.

This is an Approov integration quickstart example for the Python Django framework. If you are looking for another Python integration you can check our list of [quickstarts](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-integration-examples/backend-api/), and if you don't find what you are looking for, then please let us know [here](https://approov.io/contact). Meanwhile, you can always use the framework agnostic [quickstart example](https://github.com/approov/quickstart-python-token-check) for Python, and you may find that's easily adaptable to your framework of choice.
